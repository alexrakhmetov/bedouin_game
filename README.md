Digitalisation of a traditional Arabic game akin to Three Men's Morris.
Developed in collaboration with my friend Cumar.

Rules:
The game has two players. They start out on the top and bottom rows. The 
game's objective is to form a straight or diagonal line that is not the 
starting position for the team.

The playing board is structured like the Three Men's Morris board. Pieces 
may move to adjacent spaces or the central space.
